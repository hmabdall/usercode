This repository is a clone of work I did at the MIT Lab for Nuclear Science studying di-Higgs production and bbgg 
decay channels at the Large Hadron Collider. The scripts interacts with data stored on the CERN computing grid. The main
file of interest is the script lib_diPhotonAnalysis.cc which contains the various event selection methods. The chainMaker.hh
is also the primary file used to interact with the data stored at CERN.
